This Terraform configuration will provision an AWS RDS MySQL instance with the specified configurations and execute the SQL commands in file.sql against that instance. Make sure you have the necessary permissions and network configurations to allow the local machine running Terraform to connect to the RDS instance. Also, ensure that the security group associated with the RDS instance allows inbound traffic on the MySQL port (usually port 3306)
